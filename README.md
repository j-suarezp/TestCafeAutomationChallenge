# Hi there!

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and express my interest in the position! 

I was recently asked to complete a technical test for the recruiting process and I wanted to say that I really enjoyed the experience!

Working on the test using TestCafe was a brand new experience for me, and I loved the challenge of learning a new tool on the fly. I was impressed by the ease of use and the thoroughness of the testing framework.

I'm passionate about software development and love to take on new challenges and learn new technologies. I believe that my skills and experience make me a strong fit for the SDET role.

I'm excited about the opportunity to join the team and bring my skills to the table. If you have any questions or would like to discuss my experience in further detail, I'd be more than happy to chat!

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills to the success of the team.

Best regards,
Juan
